                Gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses are increasingly prevalent in mainstream consumer electronics. Applications of these sensors include user interface, augmented reality, gaming, image stabilization, and navigation. This talk will demonstrates how all three sensor types work separately and in conjunction on a modified Android handset running a modified sensor API, then explains how algorithms are used to enable a multitude of applications.

                attaching an accelerometer to the right lower leg of the user. Histogram

                Five biaxial accelerometers placed on the right hip, dominant wrist,
                non-dominant upper arm, dominant ankle, and non-dominant thigh were used to
                collect data from 20 subjects. Twenty daily activities were considered. Mean
                energy, frequency-domain entropy, and correlation of acceleration data were
                calculated, and C4.5, instance-based learning, decision tables,
                and Naive Bayes classifiers in WEKA were tested using these features.

                Researchers present a fast and robust algorithm for extracting significant places 
                from a set of raw GPS data points. The research took place in Australia at a mining

                GPS data points. Using the hauling vehicles, data was gathered and collected using a 
                scoring algorithm to determine the places of significance.

                Researchers analyzed temporal and spatial interactions in an Association Network that 
                integrated GPS, RDF Metadata, and Data Mining. The experiment generated random data for 133 
                "targets," 33 of which were "terrorists" and the rest were control units. Data was recorded for 
                60 days at 10 second intervals and kept the generation within Athens, GA. They implemented Data 
                Mining tools such as Binning and Association Rules to find interesting places and "targets" that 
                were associated with other "targets." The probability of someone being at a meeting if the "target" 
                was at a meeting and the likelihood of someone visiting a place if the "target" visited the place 
                were found and using these statistics and multiplying them by their semantic scores, spatial being 
                in the same area as a target and temporal being people who met with the target, two final results 
                were produced.

                Statistical formulas to determine these "interesting locations." The main topic dealt with was "Stay 
                Point Determination," wherein an individual spent a significant amount of time in a location, either 
                indoors – where they would enter, lose signal, and exit – or a general outdoor location, both determined

                MIT Media Lab has a focus on <a href="http://reality.media.mit.edu/">reality
                mining</a> which involves getting information from mobile phones to get insight
                into individual and group behavior. The project involved giving 100 students a
                cell phone and collecting all of the data. The focus here is on learning from
                mobile phone data, but the focus is not on sensor data and much of the focus
                is on group behavior and social networks. Thus, the focus is largely different
                than that of the WISDM lab. There is a short movie on
